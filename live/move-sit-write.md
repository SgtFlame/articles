# Move Sit Write

Today I ran across [this](http://www.tatumfjerstad.com/) website, where the author is also the creator of the [Move Sit Write](https://soundcloud.com/tatum-fjerstad-move-sit-write/move-sit-write-letting-go?in=tatum-fjerstad-move-sit-write/sets/move-sit-write-o-the-podcast) podcast.

I have yet to listen to all of the podcast, but I really love the premise.  After reading a lot of Tatum Fjerstad's writing, I can say that she really knows what she's talking about and every minute you spend 

I love this so much that I'm adding Move, Sit, and Write as a top level tag.
