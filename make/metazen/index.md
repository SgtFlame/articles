# Meta Zen

Meta Zen is a meta programming environment where you write code that reads and writes code.

As you progressed through your career, I'm sure you noticed that there are a whole lot of things that you end up writing and rewriting.  Patterns quickly emerge and you end up spending over half of your time doing things that could be automated.

IDE's try to help with refactoring tools and code generation, but they generally try to solve only specific problems (such as code generators for a particular database mapping product, or refactoring tools for a specific language).

With Meta Zen you can import source code, take portions of it, refactor it according to your needs (or bring it up to your exquisite standards), manipulate it the way you would manipulate a datatabase, text document, or other object models, and then generate beautiful code.

You can import the data model from an existing database, import portions of source code from the application that uses the data model, and then export a new and improved data model and create a whole new application in a completely different language.

Do you love some piece of open source software, but you can't get passed the language it uses or some other architectural / design choices the original developers made.  Forking or rewriting take a tremendous amount of effort, and then you don't get the benefit of the continuing development from the original project.

By creating specific refactoring, source manipulation, and generation rules, you can continue receiving source drops from a vendor and export an updated version of your app, complete with all of your refactoring, language choice and other improvements.
